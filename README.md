# Harnessing FABRIC for Scalable Human Genome Sequence Analysis

# Getting Started with [FABRIC](https://fabric-testbed.net/)

## How to get access to FABRIC?

## Starting a slice on FABRIC (basic)

Please follow the codes provided in [this](https://github.com/MU-Data-Science/GAF/blob/main/Getting_started/first_step.ipynb) notebook to create a slice and run a simple experiment on it.

## Creating a cluster with two nodes on FABRIC (advanced)

Please follow the codes provided in [this](https://github.com/MU-Data-Science/GAF/blob/main/Getting_started/connecting_two_nodes.ipynb) notebook to create a homogeneous(same compute site) cluster of two nodes and initiate a communication between the nodes.
